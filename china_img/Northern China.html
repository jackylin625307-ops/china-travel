            <p>The Great Wall is ancient China's most magnificent military defense project, stretching over 20,000 kilometers across 15 provinces and autonomous regions, including Hebei, Beijing, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu. Construction began in the 7th century BC during the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period. After the unification of the six kingdoms, Emperor Qin Shihuang first connected sections of the wall into a coherent whole. The Ming Dynasty section is the most well-preserved and remains one of China's most famous tourist attractions.

                  The Great Wall is not only a fortification but also a symbol of ancient Chinese wisdom and perseverance. It is considered one of the "Seven Wonders of the World" and was designated a World Cultural Heritage in 1987.</p>
