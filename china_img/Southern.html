        <p>West Lake, located west of the Old City of Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province, China, is one of the first national key scenic spots in mainland China and one of China's top ten scenic spots. It is one of China's major scenic freshwater lakes.

            Bounded by Hangzhou city to the east and surrounded by mountains on the other three sides, West Lake is divided into five parts by Solitary Hill, Bai Causeway, Su Causeway, and Yanggong Causeway: Outer West Lake, Xili Lake (also known as "Hou Xihu" or "Houhu"), Beili Lake (also known as "Lin Xihu"), Xiaonan Lake (also known as "Nanhu"), and Yuehu Lake, with Outer West Lake being the largest. Gushan is the largest natural island in West Lake. Su Causeway and Bai Causeway span the lake, while three artificial islands—Xiaoyingzhou, Huxinting, and Ruan Gongdun—stand in the center of Outer West Lake. Leifeng Pagoda and Baochu Pagoda stand opposite each other across the lake, forming the basic layout of "one mountain, two pagodas, three islands, four embankments, and five lakes."
            
            West Lake was designated one of the first national key scenic spots (1982), one of China's top ten scenic spots (1985), and one of the first national 5A-level tourist attractions (2006). The Hangzhou West Lake Cultural Landscape was also inscribed on the World Heritage List.</p>
